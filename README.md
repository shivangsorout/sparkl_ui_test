# Building and Running the Flutter Application

## Prerequisites:
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Flutter SDK:** Follow the official Flutter installation instructions for your operating system.
- **Dart SDK:** Flutter requires the Dart SDK. It's included with the Flutter SDK, so you don't need to install it separately.
- **Android Studio/VS code or Xcode:** Depending on whether you're targeting Android or iOS, you'll need either Android Studio/VS code or Xcode installed.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository:
	```
	git clone https://github.com/shivangsorout/sparkl_ui_test
	```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
	```
	cd <project_directory>
	```
3. Install dependencies:
	```
	flutter pub get
	```

## Running the Application:
- **Android**   
Ensure you have an Android device connected via USB or an Android emulator running.   

- Run the command in terminal:
 ```
 flutter run
 ```
- **iOS**   
Ensure you have a macOS machine with Xcode installed.   

- Run the command in terminal:
 ```
 flutter run
 ```

## Features implemented:
### Expected Features:
 - [x] Implemented Static UI as it is.
 - [x] Implemented all animations as specified
 - [x] Implemented background spray animation
 - [x] Implemented camera integration

## NOTE
**Some elements of the UI may be misplaced as I have only one device(Samsung S21 FE) to test the application UI. So some elements may be misplaced otherwise all features were implemented as it is.**
